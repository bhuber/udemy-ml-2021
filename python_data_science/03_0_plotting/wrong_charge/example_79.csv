Describe your issue: Hello,

I have been trying to figure out why even though I have already submitted evidence to you guys that I do you have a paid subscription to use the pro features in Canva, I'm still not able to use them. I have verified that I'm on the right account and for the last two months I have not been able to use my pro features.
I was really looking forward to using this in my business, but honestly I have not received the customer service I expected after paying for my annual subscription.
 I would like to get a refund since I have not heard from you guys about this issue.

I'm very unsatisfied with the customer service I have received.

Please contact me ASAP. 
Sincerely,
 Cynthia Mead",0.3495563268661499
