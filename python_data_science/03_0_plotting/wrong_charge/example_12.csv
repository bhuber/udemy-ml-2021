Refund request reason: Hi Canva Team,
I had opted for the Canva Pro 30-day trial version just to see what Canva has to offer. I used it for a few days and then I left working on it because of other & some personal reasons but yesterday (on 6th Feb. 2021) I received an invoice from my Bank about this Canva transaction and I was like what? I didn't know that it renews automatically otherwise I would have deleted my account or removed my payment method. And now it has automatically deducted money from my PayPal account. I was not using Canva for so many days and I'm not planning to use it in the future. Canva is great but I have changed my complete working line and I want a refund for this. Hope you understand.

I would like to ask for a full refund for the yearly Canva Pro subcription that I has been charged today on 23 January.

The reason I am requesting a refund is because I did subcribe 30 day free trial to use one of Canva Pro' function a few times for my little project. I didn't intend to use Canva Pro for long term as it is unnecessary for me. And $119.40 is really a great deal of money to me whom come from a countryside in Vietnam and now unemployment.
I paid by Visa so please would you deposit the refund into my Visa too?

Refund request reason: Hi Canva, I thought that I have canceled my Canva Pro subscription yesterday before my monthly billing, but it seems like I have been charged.

It has only be a day and I hope you understand. I love Canva and would love to continue to work with your platform as a FREE user.

Refund request reason: Hi there! I just claimed my offer with the Canva/GitHub collaboration and claimed my offer for Canva Pro (but I had already signed up with Canva Pro 11/2020...a little over 2 months ago) 

Is there any possible way I can get a refund on this charge SO that I can properly use my claim (even if I paid the monthly fee for November + December? 

I have been using Canva/paying monthly for quite some time and I'm a big supporter. I would really like to use my claim from GitHub please!! Thank you!!!",0.39203330874443054

Refund request reason: I actually wasn't aware that I had chosen to trial Canva Pro. I usually only pay for individual images because I know that I wouldn't use Canva Pro enough to justify the cost. Is there anyway to get a refund for the past month that I was charged? If there is a way to check, I never even used any of the Pro benefits because I didn't know I was on it!

I'd appreciate very much if you could help me with that. Thank you very much, Paola Pereira.

Refund request reason: I canceled my account and was charged three separate times for the end of January to February 18th. What is this charge? I tried Canva Pro and did not see the need so I cancelled. I am fine paying for the last month I have access to it because that is fair but why was I charge two more times since? Once for $10.05 and $11.23 for the same invoice reason of Canva Pro until February 18. but I already paid that for $12.95. What are these next two charges. I have not even made a design in the last two weeks. I really have loved Canva this far and would love to see this sorted out.",0.1981956958770752
