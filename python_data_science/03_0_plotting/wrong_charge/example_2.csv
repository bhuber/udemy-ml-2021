I am quite confused as I cancelled my free trial, only to find that I have been charged £107.88 for the year?

I registered for a free trial at Canva to see if I can benefit from it, to design posts for my social media page. After trying to design a post I found it hard to do it from start therefore I tried using the Available templates, but unfortunately I wasn’t able to put up a proper post so I didn’t use it afterwards.

Yesterday only I noticed it when I saw my credit card bill.

I did a trial and tried to cancel the next day to prevent renewal as I did not intend to use Canva. I just wanted to see if upgrading would be beneficial but it did not appear to be.

Refund request reason: Good evening,

I was sure that I cancelled my subscription to Canva months ago, and once reviewing my finance for 2020, I noticed that I have still been getting billed monthly. Canva is a great platform, but I no longer had a reason for using it. If you look back in my account history, I'm sure you can see that I have not had any activity on my account for a while. I am therefore asking if it would be possible to get a refund for the months I have not been active. 

Kind regards, 
Martha Garbe",0.451602578163147

Refund request reason: Hello, support team!
First of all, I apologize for bothering you.
I'm the Administrator and I'm hosting the Lunar Year-End Party for my company in January (according to the Chinese calendar). 
So I signed up for the 1-MONTH PACKAGE ($13) for January use. But I made a serious mistake that I clicked on the 1-YEAR PACKAGE ($119). It wasn't until my Credits were charged on January 12nd that I realized my mistake.
I thought a lot that should I ask for your support, because it's all my fault in this case. 
To be honest in Vietnam, $119 is a BIG AMOUNT for me because my monthly salary is only $400.
I know how difficult it is to ask you to refund all $119. So I just expect to get as much back as possible. 
For example: Now is the end of Jan (1 months from the registration date) so I agree to pay 1-month fee and just expect to receive around $100-$105.
Please kindly consider helping me if you can. I really need this amount. 
I so appreciate it. Thank you very much!",0.31760895252227783
