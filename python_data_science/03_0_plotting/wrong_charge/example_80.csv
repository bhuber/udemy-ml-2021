Refund request reason: I did not cancel the trial in time and the money was taken today. I am not using this product. Please can I get a refund and cancel the subscription? Thank you",0.8772863745689392

Refund request reason: Hello,
I have been looking through bank statements and did not realise this subscription was still active and perhaps has auto-renewed. I have not even used this product for a number of months, since first using it. If at all possible, would I be able to receive a refund for the monthly billing’s I have not used? I do not know if you can see when the account was used, however I know I used your product back in March last year to produce and print some posters, and I think I may have used it a couple months later without realising I was paying for premium. 

I understand if this is not possible, but your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
<NAME>",0.8663708567619324

Refund request reason: I started a trial to test the product “Canva Pro” and I was unable to cancel the trial in time to prevent being charged.

I look forward to hearing back from you. Thank you.",0.7970954775810242
