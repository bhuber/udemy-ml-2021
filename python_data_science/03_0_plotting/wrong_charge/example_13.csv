Describe your issue: After multiple emails and the initial case being closed on your end this is NOT resolved. I see that I do not have Pro anymore as I am being asked to try it for free but I have NOT received a refund to my credit card for this charge as of yet. Please review this again and advise. I do not want pro as I do not use it and I would like this refunded as soon as possible!  Please advise what has transpired on your end. The pro account has been disabled but I still paid for it!

ioxxyd,"Refund request reason: Hello,

A week or so ago I subscribed for a trial period which I thought I would not be charged for - at least that’s what it said: free trial. I noticed EUR 107.88 still being reserved in my bank account so I immediately cancelled the trial hoping this money would be returned to me. That didn't happen, so I'm now left with an account that's not even Pro but that I've been charged for. I was sent an email with my ‘’subscription details’’ also stating I would be only charged on Feb 19. Thing is, I can't even find an invoice under Billing & Teams, so this looks truly sketchy. It’s absolutely unacceptable and I’m hoping my funds will be returned immediately. Would love to attach screenshots, but you only allow ones from Canva, not from email or bank account. Is this seriously ok???

Refund request reason: I  have had a free Canva account since 2017. I have hardly ever used it. I was unaware that my account was going to be upgraded without my consent. I have been on summer holidays here in Australia and hence have not been attentive to my emails. Upon a search, I discovered an email from Jan 18 telling me of this new charge starting on Jan 23. This is only a one week notice, with no reminder emails. Hence, I was surprised to see a charger come through from PayPal for $17.99. I have since cancelled my Canva account so as not to incur anymore charges. I would appreciate you refunding this amount to my PayPal account as I did not give authority for this charge to be made or my account to be upgraded. Thank you, <NAME>",0.8360807299613953

Describe your issue: There is a secondary account associated with my information that accrues charges and has since at least April 2020. This is my third attempt at resolving this issue. The handle email is an old email address which I no longer use, but you are unable to communicate with me regarding that account from any other email address. Due to the nature of this year and the fact that it is an old email address, it is very difficult for me to keep up with resolution. I have been working with Canva to resolve this issue for several months. I understand that this isn't anyone's fault in particular, but I am so incredibly frustrated and angry at the loss of money spent on a redundant subscription no one uses, as well as the time I've spent trying to pursue resolution. At one point, I worked long enough with a representative to be told I would receive a full refund, which, did not occur. Upon receiving your response, I will forward the recent charge details. I'm very familiar with the process and you're required info because of how many times I've had to contact support. 

Again, please know I understand this isn't anyone's fault, but I'm so incredibly upset. So much money has been lost, and I keep having to start new tickets for various reasons. If there's anyway we can communicate more effectively, please provide me with that option. I would love to communicate with someone over a phone call.

Refund request reason: Hello,

I signed up through Canva through an AD last year to try it out for the trial. It was in June of 2020 I believe. I have not used any of your services since, please check my records. My bank flagged these transactions. Can someone please confirm that the subscription cancellation has been done correctly? Also, because I have not used any features, products or services from Canva since the month I signed up, there have been 7 charges on my account, can I please be reimbursed for this? 

Signing up for the free trial, I did not realize I needed to manually cancel the subscription (I apologize I did not see the fine print), it was so long ago but I thought it would send me a reminder. 

Help with this issues would be greatly appreciated.

On 3 separate occasions I was told the refund had been made to a bank account. Unfortunately I had paid via PayPal so you don't have any bank account details and so no money could have been returned to my account. I have sent numerous emails asking for confirmation of the bank account this refund was sent to and have never received a reply. Over the last 4 months not one email has been answered confirming where this refund was sent. I have emailed customer services numerous times asking for the information to be sent and also asking for a direct email because every request sent to customer service has been closed down saying that the request has been fulfilled.  No matter how many emails I sent, nobody has provided any proof that the refund has been made. I have never received any reply to the questions I have asked. I recently received an automated email asking for 72 hours to investigate the situation. The very next day I receive another email saying the request had been closed down because I haven't made contact. This has happened 4 times in the last month and all I am requesting is proof that the refund was made, when it was made and the account it was sent to. If you cannot send me that info, I would suggest that NO refund has been made or it's been sent to another account because I have never received it.

Hi <NAME>
  I was suddenly charged earlier this morning 509 Philippines Pesos which is my LAST money from my GCASH account. We were supposed to go out for a VERY IMPORTANT MEETING this morning and I missed it! Im going to to use that money for the Grab ride since Grab only accepts cash payments and now its Gone. See, I am a single mother busy with everyday life studying, working my kids school and all that I barely have time to check on the emails and I have 2 emails. I wasnt even informed and upon checking it earlier today after I got a text that I was charged the Canva PRO features is NOT even working! I paid for something thats not even working! Please please refund my money. This is already a bad start for me with Canva. I never ever used it and based on what happened today I dont think I will ever use canva ever again I'll stick with Adobe as this is such a horrible experience charging me without consent and it's not even working! I need to go out tomorrow. Without any notification! Please Please Please REFUND my money to my Globe GCASH account <NUMBER>

Refund request reason: Hi there,

I am emailing you to request a refund for the canva subscription. I am a very poor university student and I only downloaded the free trial for Canva to complete a university assignment. I thought I had cancelled the subscription so it would not renew - however, I have just had an email to say I have been charged £107.88 for the renewal, so I have contacted you ASAP. I am so poor as it is with losing my job alongside of university due to COVID, please please can this get refunded, as I simply cannot afford it and now have £6 left in my account. I haven't used canva since doing my assignment before Christmas. I am really freaking out and struggling knowing this money has just come out of my account.

***Please see the below. I have contacted Canva about a subscription which I am paying for an old place of work.

This subscription is attached - i think - to my old email which will no longer exist which is <EMAIL>  I just didn't find the response I received below useful as it doesn't take what i have described is my issue, into account.

Please can some one resolve this issue for me and cancel the payment. I'm not sure if I would be entittiled to a refund as I never got to take advantage of the pro version for work purposes.

Refund request reason: Hi, my name is Breanna  Williams. I have two issues that has just been brought to my attention after carefully reviewing my emails. I was initially charged for a yearly subscription of $119.40 on February 2, 2020 for the subscription I did not authorize. I then was charged for the renewal fee of $119.40 again for the same subscription that I did not authorize on my account for February 2, 2021. I am currently ONLY subscribed to a monthly account with you all, which I am billed for every month in the amount of $12.99 according to my APPLE PAY receipts. 

Having done some additional reading I  noticed you all platform experienced a breach in security sometime in May of 2019 and  unfortunately I believe my information was compromised then, hence the yearly subscription I was signed up for. I’m also seeing content on my account that I did not create. I just changed my password information today on February 3, 2020 to minimize any future fraud activity on my account. Having reviewed the invoice that was sent to me on February 2, 2020, I noticed that the invoice included a “Brand ID” name which included a very unprofessional  ID “<NAME> aM” that I myself would have NEVER created. Additionally, the invoice also provided a “Tax Invoice #<NUMBER>” number. Despite these obvious signs of fraud activity on my account, several other things stood out to me regarding this mysterious and shady invoice I was sent for a subscription I did not authorize. I noticed that the body of the February 2, 2020 invoice that “appeared” as if it came from you all system directly, was actually a phishing email because the body and footer of the email was different than the renewal email I just received. There was actually no hyperlink for me to automatically click “support” get to this form to submit my concerns on the initial invoice.

In retrospect, I would like to flag this account and request to reverse the fees in the total amount of $238.80 back to my account. Thank you for you support in resolving my concerns, I truly appreciate it.

<NAME>, Thanks for your quick reply. In answer to your questions, there is no account, invoice number, invoice date, or any other information because I never created an account or placed an order. However, I found the following charge on my bank statement:

Describe your issue: Hi there, I have been liasing with other members of the team and I am now more familiar with what is going on. I have definitely been charged for 2 subscriptions. I have 2 payments related to my Canva, one from My bank account and one from my Apple statement each month. I am reaching out because I am sure there is no need for 2 payments. This has been going on since July this year. I am requesting that you investigate and advice or confirm that I will be able to get the money back. This is really a need as I am struggling to get through these hard times financially a bad keep my business a float. Plus there is absolutely no need for me to have these 2 payments. I did try to change my email and now it seems I have 2 accounts. The accounts are:

<EMAIL> (which I believe has been cancelled) 

<EMAIL>

I have liased with 2 other advisors and haven’t seem to get the results I need . If you wish to call me to sort this please do. I am really not happy about this error

Describe your issue: HI

I ordered a free trial and forgot to cancel it, it was on yearly payment as well and took 107 from my account, and due to being out of a job because of covid it was my last money, I understand it was my own fault for not cancelling the free trial on time, but I forgot about it and I did't recieve a reminder. 
I think I somehow accepted the free trial on another account, but I can't seem to figure out how to log into the other account, I can't find any canva emails on any of my email accounts to find it! On this one I don't see any invoices or billing information so it must be from another account. 

1) Could you help me find out what email it was for ( I have a paypal payment number?)
