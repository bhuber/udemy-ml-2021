Describe your issue: Hello Sir/Madam,

We have participated in the Canva free trial it said we will take the money in one month if you don't cancel it, we canceled our account before the one month, but they took the money on the day we accepted the free trial.
I hope you guys refund our money and stay true with your promise.

I'm using Canva Pro Trial which will end on March 2, 2021. Does the offer ""Pay for 1, get 4 free"" apply to me?

Or should I cancel the trial and subscribe to the Canva Pro Plan before the offer end?
