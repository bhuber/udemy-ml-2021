Refund request reason: Hi! Canva team

I have registered for the free trial of Canva Pro on approximately 23 December 2020. The free trial version request for my credit card information in which it was required prior to use. However, I have noted that the expiry date is within the next 30 days which would be the 23 January 2021 and I planned to unsubscribe it before the expiry date. Before in this case I technically mean at 23.59 of that day and I actually did. I even did way before the day end but somehow the subscription automatically extend my contract until the January of 2022. That's a lot of money and I wish to refund it immediately. The subscription suppose to be month-to-month extension not in year-to-year. Please consider my case seriously because this really hurts my feelings toward Canva app. 

To be honest, the platform was really good and I really enjoyed it but in this period of time I do not have any works related to this field, yet. However, if the next time I require designing platform, Canva won't be on top of my list because with this kind of errors it really negatively affect my perceptions toward your organisation and I'm sure others will think the same.

Please allow the refund and maintain long-term advantages with your customers instead of this last one big win.",0.688067615032196

I would be really happy if you could give me a refund and quit the Abo. I would prefer to have one when I really use it. but at the moment I just don't. I would be really grateful for the refund.

Refund request reason: Hi there, 
I was hoping to be refunded for the past three months billing. I had no idea I was even subscribed to a billed plan until I saw my bank statement. Honestly I'm not sure how I got signed on.

You can check that I did not use canva for those 3 months and my account was just being charged with no warning.
