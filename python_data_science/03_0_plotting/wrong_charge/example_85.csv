r2j2J0xEyBqtq56o,"Hi canva


I’m <NAME>, I’m having an issue to sign in to this email 2 weeks ago.AS thought the reminder will be sent to the joint email <EMAIL> to remind me about the subscription. I would like to refund my money that was charged cause I’m not using canva since 10 dec 2020 the date after it registered. 

I’m already email to u before using <EMAIL> to refund my money on 9 January 2021.

Hopefully you can help me out because I really need you to refund it back.

Thank you

reGDkbuEQERkGucD,"Hello Canva Team,

This is MD Amit,

I use your service as a trial, but now you charged me for 1 year without any mail and message, 

So I would request you do cancel my subscription and back my money asap.

As a student I can't afford your subscription plan for 1year , but I will renew it for just 1 month if required.

So refund my money, and this is your responsibility to inform your customer first then renew, I never seen this type of service I am using almost every platform and they are very professional atleast they're reminder their customer before renewal. 

but you are not informed me, now I got a message form my bank that my money is deducted.

So this a formal request to you refund it.

Thanks and regards
MD AMIT

I just checked my credit card account and saw I have 3 months of a subscription to canva. At first I was very alarmed and thought it was fraud. Especially when I called the number attached which was a library in Delaware. After tracing my emails I started to remember the website. Either way,
I did not mean to subscribe to this website. I was looking at templates for a school project while having a manic episode. I hope you understand or are aware of the struggles when in a manic state. That same day I tried to kill myself so that day was a blur. I assume I must have unknowingly subscribed to canva. I am out of a job due to covid and am not receiving financial assistance. I do not have the funds to pay for something I didn’t even use. Sorry for the extra information. I would really like to refund these charges. Please take all this into consideration.

Hello there,

Thanks for getting in touch. We understand you want to cancel your subscription and get a refund as it was not your intention to renew it. We’re here to help you.

We can confirm that your account under the email address <EMAIL> was charged USD 358.20 for the renewal of your Canva Pro yearly subscription for 3 members. In Canva, you are billed for the subscription of each member in each Canva Pro brand that you created.

We can also see that you signed up for our Free Trial last November 24, 2020, and after the trial expired, it upgraded automatically to a yearly subscription that you have selected when you signed up. We sent an email reminder 3 days prior to the end of your trial.

No cancellation was made before the renewal happened and that's the reason you've been charged for your account. Our billing system follows the GMT timezone for all transactions and payments.

As a goodwill gesture, we have issued a full refund to your credit card and canceled your paid subscription. You are now on the standard (free) version of Canva, so rest assured that you will no longer be billed for any renewal fee. You can continue using your Canva account without worrying about the upcoming payments.

You may expect the funds to reflect in your account within <NUMBER>business days as the processing time varies based on your bank’s internal protocols. You can follow up with them for updates.

We hope this puts your mind at ease. Please don’t hesitate to get back in touch if we can lend a hand with anything else.

All the best,
<NAME>

r7yVnT9ErCrYdJnn,"Hello, I don't show that I have a paid subscription yet $12.95 has come out of my account more than 1x. When I go to billing and teams it says subscription subscriptions for your team:personal and under that it says no active subscriptions. So since I don't appear to have an account I can't figure out how to cancel it. 

Kindly refund the money taken and cancel my subscription that I don't have.

Thanks,
<NAME>

rZpm2reeMvgEKSf8,"Hello,  

I am emailing you in order to receive a reimbursement to my account for the $12.95 that was billed on 12/28. 

I had a free one month trial with Canva and did not want to go on a monthly subscription. I got billed automatically but did not receive any type of reminder mentioning that I would. I have not used my account since and do not plan on doing so, so could you please proceed to the reimbursement on the $12.95 and stop this monthly subscription. 

Thank you in advance,

<NAME>

rCKQqzZXOdXGm1ic,"Hi there's,

Is it possible to reverse my payment to Canva? I haven't used the app in a month and didn't want to continue the payment. With Covid at the moment I can't afford it. 

Is there any way?
