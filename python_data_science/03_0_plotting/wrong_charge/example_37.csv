Refund request reason: My nephew told me he needed to use Canva for a school project so I let him use an account I had previously created but don't use that much. As he is quite young he unknowingly activated a free trial by trying to use some of the Pro features, as he didn't understand that they had to be paid for. My nephew no longer needs to use Canva and I am only interested in using free features on the rare occasion I do use the app. I am hopeful that you will issue me a refund to help correct an honest mistake.",0.34156763553619385
