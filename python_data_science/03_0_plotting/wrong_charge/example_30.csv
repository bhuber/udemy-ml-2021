I never meant to sign up to a a yearly charged service. I have cancelled my Canva subscription to immediate effect, and since I have contested this charge within 24 hours of my unexpected payment, I would expect to receive a full refund for this amount. As seen in the screenshot attached, I have not even confirmed/verified the account! I'd be very grateful if you could please arrange this reimbursement as soon as possible. Many thanks
