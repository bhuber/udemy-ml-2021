Describe your issue: Hi,

I tried to cancel my canva pro subscription, however, I have just been charged. I tried several ways to cancel my subscription and in the end I had to disconnect my card as there seemed to be a website error whenever I attempted to cancel it. I received a confirmation email that my card was no longer connected to the account, however, I have now been charged for the subscription. I've tried to cancel the subscription again but the user keeps on freezing. 
Please could someone look into this for me? I'd appreciate a refund of the £107+ that has been taken out of my account when I was under the impression that I had cancelled my account when it was confirmed my card had been disconnected. The website made it very confusing and I did try several times and thought I was successful with cancelling the subscription.

I hope this makes sense! :)

Describe your issue: Hi, I have 2 Canva accounts - one I was using as a free test account, and one I wanted to have Canva Pro.

I've already set up lots of designs on my other one that I wanted to continue my Pro trial on. This account is my 'test' one.

However when I tried to apply the Pro upgrade to my main account after my trial finished, my phone applied it to this test account instead. So it's now the wrong way round, which is causing issues with my clients (I'm a designer).

Is there a way to get a refund on the yearly Pro fee on this account? And I will repurchase this on my other account <EMAIL> ? I tried to do this through the 'Request a refund' section but it's not working because no invoices are showing. I do have an invoice in my emails though from Apple. There's no option for me to switch teams and see my invoice.

In short, I'd like a refund/cancellation of the Pro features on this account please!
