Describe your issue: Hi,

I keep on messaging you guys about a refund and for some reason it always replying to me that you haven't received my email when I definitely did send it. 

I am emailing for the 4th time, please refund me back my money for an automatic subscription payment, I already cancelled my subscription so nothing has to do left aside from giving me back my money. It was charged on my Google account thats why I can't find my invoice in the app. 

Please send me an email so I can provide a copy of screenshot charged on my account.


Kind regards,
