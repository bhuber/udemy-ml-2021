Describe your issue: Hi there,

I just received an invoice for €11.99 for a subscription I never signed up for. 
I had cancelled my subscription months ago, removed my card details and yet you have some how charged me for something I never agreed to. I want a refund for the €11.99 you have taken from account immediately and want my account deactivated. 

To this day, I am receiving junk and scam emails because of Canva. Instead of protecting my information, you allowed it be taken by hackers. And now, you are using my card to charge me for something I don't want. 

This is so frustrating as I did enjoy using this free platform. I expect a full refund as soon as possible.

Refund request reason: See Support Request Id: <NAME>>ID-wfcx4w | <NUMBER>your support emails go to spam (MS exchange) and as a result you closed this request without resolving it. Here is my latets message: Hi Canva,

My banks tells me the charge is because Canva is billing me from a non-Australian bank account. Is this correct? Why? Per your invoice, you are an Australian entity billing me in AUD so you should be charging me from an Australian account in AUD so that the cost to me is the agreed $17.99. 

I have previously suggested this is the problem and canva support have ignored this. Please pass this dispute on to your manager or someone else who has greater oversight and ability to resolve. 

Many thanks,

Hi <NAME>,
It is important for us to attend to your concerns and give assistance the soonest we can.
We want to thank you for your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry if it took us a while to get back to you regarding this matter.
Apologies for the inconvenience this has caused you.
We checked the invoice you sent to us but what we can see here in our end is that you were being charged an amount of AUD 17.99 only.
Price	Status	Invoice Details	Invoice Date	Charge Date
AUD 17.99	PAID	<NUMBER>Dec 20, 2020	Dec 20, 2020
Upon reviewing the screenshot you have provided it clearly shows there that the AUD 1.64 is included on the total charge of your Canva Pro subscription which is AUD 17.99.
Where you able to contact your bank in regards to the exceeded amount that was charged to your account they might have been charging you for a transaction fee for purchasing Canva.
The usual amount for subscription here in Canva is just AUD 17.99 we highly suggest to contact your bank right away for further clarification.
We hope this helps! Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.
Many thanks,
Canva Team",0.34873107075691223
