Describe your issue: Hello Again,I have provided all the information you requested and have had no response from you.
I am following up on my refund request and update you on the action I have taken in an effort to resolve the situation.  As it was not resolved by February 3rd, I have contacted my bank to cancel my card and the bank will begin the fraud investigation. As you can see from the line item taken from my bank statement included in my previous contact with you, it was billed and paid as a Canva transaction. I assume you are as concerned about where that money went as I am. I am on disability and that is a huge hit for me. Thank you for your help and I anticipate my monies will be refunded promptly.

dqk9gu,"What kind of problem ?: Other Please describe your problem: Hello, I have activated the annual subscription without my consent. I have noticed now as I have never used the PRO version (I hope you can verify this from your servers). According to canva, the free trial started on November 22nd and the charge of over € 100 took place on December 22nd. I can prove that it was activated by mistake because all the presentations I created after November 22nd were created with the BASIC version. I can send them to you (there are images with walmart etc ...) In November I tried to activate the free trial month (not the year) but the site crashed at the time of billing. I therefore have reason to believe that there was a charging error and I would like a refund of the annual subscription. Thank you. Best regards",0.6282584071159363

I have been with you for over a year. My business and personal health have both taken a blow during COVID and as such, I have been unable to build my website, and use your service, as you can see from my login activity. My business has generated no revenue at all this year due to the commercial real estate market. In addition, my health has been compromised, not affording me the option of working on my website which is why I hit Canva. I would like to keep my Canva however can no longer afford it after paying for over a year of non usage.

Can you PLEASE do whatever you can to either extend my subscription for an additional year at no charge or provide me with the maximum courtesy credit possible as I have been paying for a service that I did not use. Based on my inability to use your service this last year due to both financial and health reasons, which you will see by my login activity. I would really appreciate it as I really want to continue to be a loyal Canva customer and use and pay for your service for years to come, when my financial and health conditions are better than what they both were this year. I thank you in advance for anything that you can do.

Stay safe and be well,
