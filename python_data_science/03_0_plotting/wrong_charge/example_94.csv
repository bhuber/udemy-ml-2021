Could I please request for a refund for 15 January, I totally forgot about this subscription and have not been using Canva regularly now. I don't think i need premium until later in the future. I have paused my account for February and March.

However, could i also pause for this month (January) too, and get a refund on the payment that was automatically deducted. 

Really appreciate any help.",0.4634150564670563
