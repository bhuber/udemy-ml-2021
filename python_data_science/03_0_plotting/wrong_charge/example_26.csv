Refund request reason: I was under the impression that I cancelled my membership in January 2020?

These multiple charges of $119.40 were not approved by me as I had cancelled my subscription and don't use Canva as much as I did in the past years. I will need to get the most recent charge of $119.40 refunded as well as the past charge of $119.40 refunded if possible.
