Refund request reason: I thought I'd be given more options and the opportunity to confirm payment before being charged - As you would expect!! - Instead I got charged right away. Please can you fix this? I am unemployed and receiving government benefits I can not afford to spend over a £100 on this, unfortunately.

Refund request reason: Good day,

I did not see the email informing me that my trial for Canva Pro was ending yesterday and that I would be charged the annual monthly fee of $155.88.

Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I cannot afford to pay this amount at this time, so I'm requesting that you please refund my credit card. Thanks for your understanding.
