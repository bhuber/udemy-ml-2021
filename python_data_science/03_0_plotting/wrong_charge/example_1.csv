Refund request reason: Hello, today I've got a withdrawal of 899 rub for subscription which I do not have. IN my account the information is that I do not have any active subscriptions, the same info is in my Apple ID and AppStore. No subscriptions is active. And this is not first time when the effort of withdrawal was made. Today it was successful because there was money on my aacount. The matter is that I don't have any subscription and I do not use your services, So, you do not have any right to take my money from my account. This withdrawal is not authrorized. So, please refund my money back and stop any further subscriptions ND WITHDRAWALS.

Refund request reason: To whom it may concern;
I downloaded canva for free in Dec 2019. I have just noticed that since then I have been charged $17.99 each month. As per below, that is a total of $251.86 over 14 months.

26.12.<NUMBER>.<NUMBER>
26.01.<NUMBER>.<NUMBER>
TOTAL	251.86	

As you can see I have not logged in or used canva since Dec 2019. I have since lost my job last year and am experiencing financial hardship, hence combing through my credit card statement and finding these canva charges.

I would like to kindly request a refund of the entire amount of the subscription payment as a) I was not aware I was being charged, b) I did not use the service at all over the last 14 months. I understand that it may not be a normal request but I would greatly appreciate the refund, in particular at this time.

Many thanks,
