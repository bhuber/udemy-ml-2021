Describe your issue: Hi there,

I deleted my account and checked the subscriptions before so and there was nothing that said I needed to “unsubscribe” or anything before the invoice date. I signed up to canva to check it out but it didn’t actually provide me with what I needed so I didn’t use it and deleted/deactivated my account before the invoice date yet I have had to re-activate my account now that I have been charged to complain about this. I am not in a financial position to just let this money leave my account. Can someone please help me with a refund and re-deactivating my account and all services?",0.6234715580940247
