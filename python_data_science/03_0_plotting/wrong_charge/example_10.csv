Refund request reason: Hi, I would like to please request a refund for about  5 months of canva. I have been trying to cancel premium membership for canva for the past few months as it was costing me a fortune, however I was unsuccessful with cancelling as it was unclear to me what I had to do to cancel. As there have been several issues with using these ""premium"" services such as; watermarks and not being able to access some of the 'canva pro' services (just to name a few) and also not using it for the past few months, so I would really appreciate it if I were to get a full refund on those months as it was not my intention to continue using canva. I have been charged several times from my debit card to your company without realising as was thinking that I may have cancelled it somehow, however that has not been the case. It hurts me and makes me very upset to see that a lot of my hard earned money on a low salary has been wasted on months worth of canva even though I have not been active on the app or website. It would really make my day and help me out a lot if I were to receive my full refund and get my money back on this. 

Thank you so much and I hope you will consider my request.

I signed up with you guys back in June to see if you platform would work with some projects I was working on.

We were planning to take it for the next month as we will be needing Canva services for our business next month. I reported the issue as soon as i received the notification and ensure you we have not used any pro service after the automatic renewal.

Please refund the amount for this month, so that we can use your pro next month when we actually need it.
