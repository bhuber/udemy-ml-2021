Refund request reason: Good morning

I was on a free trial with Canva and got automatically billed on 28/01/2021 without any prior notification through email which should have been received as a gentle reminder to decide if I wanted to terminate my subscription or continue.
Therefore, I am not happy and would like a full reversal or refund of my transaction as soon as possible please.

Kind regards

ad26f3,"What do you need help with?: I don't want to pay a years subs up front. I didn't sign up for that.
I was tempted into a free month and meant to cancel but forgot.
I'm happy to pay a month but that year sub has taken all my pay pal money which I need as i have no wages coming in at the moment.
I thought this was a good company but this is sharp practise and I don't want to not be able to turn my back without getting a big bill.
I DONT WANT OR NEED A YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION. HAPPY TO PAY A MONTH AS IT WAS MY STUPIDITY THAT LET THE FREE TIME RUN OVER.
PLEASE REFUND AS I NOW HAVE NO MONEY TO PAY MY OTHER BILLS.
NOT ON' HEAVY HANDED, CHEEKY. WRONG BAD. NOT HAPPY.
MY NEEDS ARE OCCASIONAL MONTHS. WILL NOT USE AT ALL IF YOU THINK IM ABUSING YOUR FREE SERVICE",0.5019282698631287

Refund request reason: Hello Canva Team, 
My subscription automatically renewed. I should have known better but I had an accident that needed a knee replacement surgery and I read my emails too late. 
Hopefully, you can be so kind and refund me the 11,99 euros. 

Thank you and happy 2021!

I set a reminder to cancel and unfortunately forgot. And now I got an email that I charged $ 119. Right with the message I deleted the account. I do not currently use the software (I intend to use it in the future but I do not currently need it) and I would be happy or you can cancel the charge. This is a considerable amount and I do not have the money to pay at the moment. When I eat and I need to, I'll connect again. I would be happy if you could consider the circumstances and cancel the charge. Thanks in advance to Yaron",0.2429955005645752
