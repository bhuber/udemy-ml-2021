59jt04,"Refund request reason: When I use your trail you  promised me that you will charge further only after sending renewal alert. But you didn' send  alert  when the trail  end. Rather you unilateral charged the amount without my consent. you cheated me. So i need the money back. you Can see that I never used this account after the trail expired. Actually I forgot the user name and password as I use multyple email accounts. Only today i got the user name. hence I logged in and cancelled the subscription. So please refund the amount
