There has been an unauthorized charge made from my credit card. As I have never chosen your ""go pro"" option or chosen any kind of subscription, I really don't understand how or why have I been charged. The amount you have charged me is 13.07 USD and the transaction was made on the 30th of December, 2020.

Hello Ingers,

Thanks for getting back to us.

Since you don’t know the other account, it’s possible that someone used your card without your authorization.

We know how important it is for you to revert the charge back to your card. In order for us to proceed with the request, please confirm your card ownership by providing the following details:

* Card type (Ex. AMEX, Visa, Mastercard):
* Last 4 digits of the card number:
* Card expiry:

You might be worried about your full credit card details being accessible if you provide the above information. We assure you that the full credit card information never passes through Canva's servers. We only store the same details we requested, and these are used only as identifying information linking your Canva account to the card.

Also, we highly discourage you to provide your full credit card number in compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).

We'll be keeping an eye out for your response.

Best regards,
<NAME>

The payment was already deducted from my card but for some reason, Canva refunded the amount.. Now, it won't accept my linked card. I tried linking my other card (BPI Debit card) but it still won't accept. I don't have any other cards and I'm not able to put funds on my Paypal account either. Can you please check what's wrong? I'm pretty sure I have enough balance on both cards and I did not have any issues before. Let me know what you need from me to solve this matter.
