Refund request reason: To Whom This May Concern,

I signed up to use a free trial for Canva and I created one project. 

After my trial, I realized that this program was not for me.

I recently saw that I was charged $155.88 and I was upset and shocked.

I thought that I would have to approve an email in order to extend the use of Canva.

I have no intention of using Canva this year. I am writing this message 3 days after my ""free month"".

I hope you are able to refund this invoice at your earliest convenience.

I look forward to hearing a response.

Describe your issue: So.. I have already requested a refund and I have received $6.99 of $25.90 (Two Payments). I had not signed up for Canva pro. In my mind, it seems I assumed that a refund request that reported not signing up for the service would have receive a full refund. Especially since there had been no usage of the service. My mistake... I would like a full refund if possible. If I must report an issue to another section, then so be it. Is there a hotline that I can talk this over with? Email? Phone number? Repetitive on site reports?

Once more I will stress. I did not sign up for this service. I did not use this service. I do not want this service.

Refund request reason: Dear Canva, 
I always use your platform with a lot of pleasure. As a student I am always upgrading my resume on a templet I created myself. I mostly use your services for this purpose only, and pay per edit update. A while ago I received an offer to try the Canva pro edition. I did so, and used the Canva again for the same purpose.  However, after a while I canceled the subscription as I only intended to try this edition out. However, it appeares that  the subscription got extended to a yearly basis charging 107,88euro. After realizing this, I immediately called my bank to arrange a refund, but I have been told that I canceled it on the same day it got extended and that they cant do anything for me.  Therefore, I really hope you can consider this refund request.  As a student I really do not have the funds to support this payment. Specially, since I do not use your services often.  I understand that I have misinterpreted the last day of cancelation, and that the subscription got extended automatically. But as you can also see in my account, I havent used your services since this!! Thus, I also have not consumed the subscription at all.  I truly hope you can refund this, and I am more than happy continue to use your service  ( and pay per use) in the future, like I always have.",0.638023853302002

Refund request reason: Hello Canva support,

I reached out in October of 2019 to have the service terminated and was informed that this was taken care of ASAP as I didn't use the service very much and didn't need a Pro account anymore.  I HAVE BEEN CHARGED FROM NOV 2019 up to JAN 2021 & I simply didn't notice until I was auditing my bank statements this month. 

Mistakes happen & I get that but this refund kindly needs to be processed & I kindly request fully deleting my Canva account as well - I do not need a free account either & will set up a new one, should this change in the future.

Please send me confirmation once the refund is processed so I don't have to begin a dispute with my bank & take unnecessary time from your accounting team on this.

Kind Regards,
