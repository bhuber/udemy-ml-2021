Refund request reason: Hello,

This invoice says $1.00, but I was actually just charged $13.77 when I signed up for your 14 day free trial. 

I have no idea why it charged me for a 14 day free trial. Can you please help me to get a refund for this? That's all the money that I had. I thought I was signing up for a free trial, since that's what it said. 

Please help me get my refund? I would greatly appreciate it! 

Again, I was charged $13.77 - not $1.00 (I've quadruple checked).  I can supply you with proof, if needed. 

Thanks a ton, and I look forward to hearing back from you! Have a good day! 

Sincerely, 

Kathleen Dougherty",0.8679875135421753

I’ve just created my account and it said at the bottom upgrade to pro for a 14 day free trial, but I’ve been charged straight away. I don’t understand why the money has left my account already when I literally wanted a trial to test how much I like the feature first. I also don’t get paid until next week and I haven’t budgeted for this expense - hence why the 14 day trial appealed to me.

Describe your issue: Hi, Can someone please contact me. This is Ara Garnett from Parañaque city. This message serves as a formal request for a full refund on my subscription on you apps which is Canva.

I accidentally purchased the subscription on January 30, 2021, and paid a total amount of 509 pesos.

At first, i thought it was a 14 days free trial, so i clicked the purchased button, then suddenly got a message from my <NAME> account and it said that my subscription to your apps successfully paid. I didn't notice that my 14 days free trial is already used. I emailed you bu lt I have no replies to my emails. I'll like a refund please.

I hope to hear from you soon about the procedure for cancelling my subscriptions and receiving a refund.

Refund request reason: Hello Canvas Tech Team,

My name is <NAME>. I downloaded the app on Dec <NUMBER>for my PR position. As I made an account, I noticed that you get 14 days free and after you pay $119.40 yearly. As a college student, I knew that I could not realistically afford that. I emailed my sorority before the 14 day free period was up, asking if Canva was really necessary to have for this position. They later told me that they already had an account and I did not need to make my own. With that being said, I deleted my subscription before the two period free trial was over because there was no need for me to have a personal account when they would provide me one of their own. I went into my apple subscriptions and I removed my personal subscription to Canva.",0.1994183361530304
