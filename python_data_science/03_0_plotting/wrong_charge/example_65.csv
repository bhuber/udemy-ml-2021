Describe your issue: I signed up for a Canva trial to assess suitability for our business to stay in touch with our clients every month. I failed to cancel prior to the end of the free trial (it was the holiday season and overlapped with vacation).  I've been charged >$155 for an annual membership that I don't want or need.  This is very disappointing and a deceiving component of the platform.  Charging a monthly fee would have been more reasonable in terms of cost for the type of service it is and an acceptable cue to cancel my membership however your policy doesn't allow for this.  This is unreasonable and doesn't instill confidence or interest in pursuing further business with Canva.  These are tough times for all businesses, our practices should be fair and flexible to our customers.

I am requesting a refund and if for some reason this is an issue I would need this card on file refunded and then I would pay the balance with a personal credit card.
