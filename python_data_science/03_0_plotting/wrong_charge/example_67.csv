Sorununuzu açıklayın: Hello, I'm writing to you for the second time. I upgraded my account to your pro package with a 1-month trial period on 25.12.2020. But I never had a trial period. The next day, 119.40 USD was withdrawn from my credit card. I have get an e-mail from you a few days ago. It was written that 119.40 USD will be withdrawn on 25.01.2021 as the first payment date. I could not try Canva Pro for free already, and I don't want to pay for the second time. I'm nervous that there is one day left to 25.01.2021. I don't know if you return me and if i pay for second time. If this fee is withdrawn for the second time, I will cancel my subscription and i will want all my money back. I request that you return to me very quickly and solve my problem and explain this situation please.
