Refund request reason: Dear Canva,
As your mention before <NAME> Pro trial, the trial time will be a month and I started on Dec 21, 2020 but your payment on Jan 20, 2021 so it's early than 01 day. Moreover, Canva will tell me 01 day before do payment, but I don't receive any email or notification before payment doing and change my decision. 
Therefore I hope that <NAME> could help to refund this invoice and cancel <NAME> Pro plan. 
Thank you and best request.

I have spoken to Admin on Facebook, <NAME>, who asked me to write a report here. I submitted to them yesterday and they responded to me at 1:30 am ish Irish time GMT.

I need to get some work out with fantastic urgency. My problem is this: I could not get my payment to fire and then contacted Canva FB admin because they are the most responsive of your team. After I deleted and reentered the same card several times, it finally initiated payment. In the mean time a bunch of other payments went off that account that I use of my online/<NAME> account. There was a client that payed late and that caused some payments, including the payment that finnally initiated ftom Canva to bounce. (crying just a little to self).

The payment was done on Friday and Irish banks do not move cash over the weekends. I am very, very stuck with work that needs to get out. The money should be in on Monday afternoon. Would you please be so kind as to give me grace until then when the payment can fire off, please? That would be tremendously kind of you.  Also, certainly massively appreciated :)
