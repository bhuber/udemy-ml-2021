2k4xxc,"Invoice no .: <NUMBER>Refund request reason: hello, good work, based on my pro version request I made on 09.12.2020, I have seen the annual fee as 34 TL and have requested to use the version, but today I saw that the mail received was 119 USD. I cannot even admit that there is a misunderstanding on the price and I do not have the budget to cover this fee. This fee is beyond my knowledge and I request a refund. I would like to inform you that I have never used the pro version of the application since the day I bought it and there is a mistake in this regard. I would like a refund of the $ 119 charged from my card. Please I would be grateful if feedback is provided as soon as possible. At the same time, I apply to the relevant unit of Garanti BBVA bank from my account with the necessary objection of $ 119. I wish you good work. love",0.3697522282600403
