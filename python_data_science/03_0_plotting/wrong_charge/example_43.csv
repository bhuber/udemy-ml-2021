Refund request reason: I select for trial use because I misunderstood that it can help for printing. I would like to cancel but no button or function to cancel anytime the same as Canva of FB information. Even if have no Canva branch contact in Thailand. I need to get a refund due to I did not use Canva Pro neither I feel unsafe to deduct my credit card without sending the notification to remind the subscription will be deducted every date. It is not the correct way to deduct any card of user without sending reminder. This is the main reason for cancellation.

Appreciated for your consideration.

Thank you
