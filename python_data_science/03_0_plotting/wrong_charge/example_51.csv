Describe your issue: Dear management,
I am hereby requesting an immediate full refund, as the company did not let me know that they are about to charge my account before. I only subscribed the 30 day free trial option to try out the difference, but I did not intend, to carry on with my subscription as I found the difference irrelevant for the money that you charge. i also think it is unethical to charges ones account without previous notice.

Dear Sirs,  

I just discovered Canva has automatically charged me  through Paypal, $17.99 every month as from 30th Dec 2020.

The fact is that I had tried to use the software from Canva from 30th Nov 2020. This is just for trial use and not more than 2 weeks. Thereafter I never use Canva software.  

I don't know Canva will automatically charge me every month thereafter, because I never give permission to Canva for this.

From Paypal record, Canva had charged the following:-

    on 30 Nov <NUMBER>Invoice ID<NUMBER>Amount -$17.99   
    on 30 Dec <NUMBER>Invoice ID <NUMBER>Amount -$17.99
    on 30 Jan  <NUMBER>Invoice ID<NUMBER>Amount -$17.99

I can accept the payment on 30 Nov 2020, and reject the payments on 30 Dec 2020 and 30 Jan 2021.

I would ask Canva to stop the automatic charge of my account via Paypal.

I also instruct Paypal to stop payment on my behalf to Canva effective immediately and arrange the refund of the 30 Dec 2020 payment and 30 Jan 2021 payment.  

Regards
Paul <NAME>

Describe your issue: Hi. I bought a picture 2 years ago for $1 and saw that I'm supposedly owing money and also that I'm on the Canva pro 30 day trial. I'm sorry, but I don't remember signing up for any of this. I think I owe $4 but I need to know what for. Thank you for your help. I love your site.",0.22297826409339905
trml8f,"What kind of problem ?: Other Please describe your problem: I would like to activate the 30 day free trial for the PRO plan, but when I try to do so, it automatically goes to request payment of the promotional offer of 5.99 for 3 months. What should I do to try only the 30 days in the meantime? I repeat that I am talking about the PRO plan (I repeat it, because in the previous ticket I did not receive an answer relating to my problem). thanks for letting me know! I await to proceed. <NAME>",0.22001437842845917
