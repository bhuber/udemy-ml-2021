Describe your issue: Was billed for renewal Jan 11 but I already had turned off auto renewal. My invoices even show it stopped but then began again in Jan. Was wondering if this is because i did not remove my credit card? And if not what caused the auto renew to turn back on. I have already cancelled my subscription again and removed my credit card. Looking to get the charge refunded as I ended it as soon as I seen the email. Thank you for any assistance on the matter hope you have a great day.",0.8679011464118958

Refund request reason: Hello!

I thought I had removed my Canva Pro trial at the beginning of my trial. I have just received an email that my account was charged for a year's prescription. I would like this to be refunded as I thought I had already removed the trial for Canva Pro.

Sorry for the trouble! I would love to have this service, but I can't afford it at this time. 

Thank you!",0.8595862984657288

Describe your issue: I have been removed from Canva Pro trial before my 30 days.  I have subscription until 12th February.

This is really disappointing as I need to use this for my work today.

I hope my card is not going to be charged early for an automatic renewal.

Could you please look into this.

Many thanks
