3b2sjj,"Refund request reason: I started the free trial of Canva pro in December 2020.  I cancelled it at the beginning of January 2021, but while going thought my bank account I saw that Canva had withdrawn $155.88. I was very surprised due to the fact that I definitely cancelled the subscription. I am upset that I never received a notification or email that gave warning before I ""paid"" for the years subscription. I would like to get a refund. Even if I have to pay for the subscription for the month of January, but can get the rest of the money back would be fine.

I subscribed for a free trial that was due 03.02.2021 and decided to cancel it today (29.01.2021) in advance. I proceeded and pressed cancel, but instead of canceling the subscription I was billed 130$ for a year plan.

Subject: Requesting a refund of my payment

Dear Ma'am/Sir,

This letter serves as a formal request for a full refund on my subscription on your apps which is Canva.

I accidentally purchased the subscriptions on January 30, 2021, and paid a total amount of 509 pesos.

At first, i thought it was a 14 days free trial, so i clicked sa purchased button then suddenly, got a messaged from my gcash account that my subscriptions to your apps is successfully paid. I didn't notice right away that my free trial is used already.

I hope to hear from you soon about the procedure of cancel subscriptions and receiving a refund.

Sincerely,

<NAME> Garnett",0.6124054193496704
