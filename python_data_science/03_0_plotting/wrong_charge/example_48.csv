Refund request reason: Hi, 

I tried Canva PRO to see if that could help me further in my work. It could not, so I decided to not continue with Canva PRO. 

Then i got sick in Covid-19 and did not remember to cancel this. Now when I got I can see you charged me for ONE year. 

I won't use Canva PRO at all and wonder if it's possible to get my money back? I know I should have cancelled it, but as I got sick I did not think of it. I can pay for one month, but please what can be done with the yearly payment? 

I'm looking forward to your reply.
