Refund request reason: Hi,

I was charged for this account though I did not use it after signing up for it. I signed up for the free trial and then cancelled it before the 30 days. But it seems the account was not cancelled, as I received a charge of 12.95 yesterday on my card. This was not an expense I allotted and I was under the impression that cancellation would be completed and not a complicated process. I would appreciate if the charge can be refunded as I did not use services after and made an attempt to cancel the pro account which for some reason did not go through.

Refund request reason: Good evening, 
I have just received this invoice unexpectedly after using the free trial of Canva Pro option. I was under the impression that I would receive a reminder that my free trial was coming to an end and that I would be billed and this was not the case. 
I am quite angered by this as I was using the pro feature to really map out everything canvas had to offer before taking it to my company and asking for us to have our own business account because I love this program so much. 
I am requesting a refund as the reminder did not occur and therefore my account nor I was prepared for this money to be taken out. 
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. 
Kind Regards, 
Piper Queen",0.6847990155220032

Refund request reason: Hi, I did the free trial and I set myself a reminder to cancel it yesterday as I wanted to avoid the charge, and I signed in yesterday but saw there was nothing to cancel so I assumed I had already cancelled it before...

Then I saw my bank statement today and saw the charge, I signed back in and realised that I was signing into an old account I had made a year ago, and the new account with the trial that ended was under a Facebook login, so essentially I got charged by mistake as I intended to cancel.

Refund request reason: Hi,
I did a 30 days free trial on Canva, but didn't want to pursue the subscription because I just needed the ""pro"" features for one artwork that I did during the free trial. I just discovered that money has been charged from my bank account. Could you please refund this amount that has been charged and I'll proceed with the cancellation of the ""pro"" plan. I thought that I'd get an email after the free trial to ask if I want to pursue the pro plan or not, but the money has been charged automatically... 

Thank you very much. 

Kind regards,
