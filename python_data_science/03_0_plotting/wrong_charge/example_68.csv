Describe your issue: Hello.  I received a message from my bank today saying that the payment of <NAME> to Canva failed to process due to expired card details.  I was not aware I was even subscribed to an annual plan so I went into my account to see and it seems that i signed up for a free trial and the amount mentioned above was to be charged today for renewal of the plan.   I had recently checked for any subscriptions on my apple account and since nothing appeared, I guessed I was not under a plan.  I would just like to clarify that I was not aware of the subscription renewal and cannot afford to pay that amount in any case. I have been using Canva for several years now and from time to time i buy some assets but I do not use it as much to be paying that amount annual.
