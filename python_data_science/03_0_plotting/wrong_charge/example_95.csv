qnpb97,"Invoice No .: <NUMBER>Reason for the refund request: Hello, I just saw that I was charged € 11.99 by Canva. The concern being that when I subscribed, to benefit from the 30-day trial, which means that I should have been charged on the 12th. In addition, during my subscription, I was assured by advertising, that I will receive a notification a few days before to be sure of my subscription, which I did not receive. Therefore I would like to be reimbursed, as I have no interest at this time in using the paid version of Canva. Thanking you. Cordially. M ALPHONSE Matthias.",0.8453011512756348

Refund request reason: I am asking for the full refund due to a couple of reasons:
1. I havent used- even open Canva for an extended period time, over a month.
2. Because of the covid-19 I was hospitalized and then had to move to another city and I lost access to my email- so I couldn't log in or change to forgotten password to unsubscribe and avoid paying the subscriptions.
3. My economical situation got much worse due to the Pandemic, so even 11.99€ may seem like not much, but in my case it is a lot, especially when I didn't use the platform and was unable to log in to cancel the subsciption on time.
