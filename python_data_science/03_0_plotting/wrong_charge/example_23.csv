Refund request reason: Hello Support team,

I hope you're safe in these difficult times. 

   Although I canceled my premium subscription on January 17th, I was still charged for another month of Canva premium. Since the 17th of January, I have not loged in lnto my account because it all seemed to have gone well with the cancellation and didn't have need for it. Today after I receive an email invoice informing me of the renewal I checked and the premium was still activated.

I can't find a reason for why this has happened. Yet since the beginning of the new lockdown I have internet issues which have not yet been resolved due to the lockdown and my choice to not receive a technician at home for a virus reasons.

Can you please give me a refund? I have plans to resubscribe in the future, but for the time being canva is not required since I am still waiting for a new job.

Thank you for understanding, I hope to hear from you soon.",0.62822026014328

Refund request reason: Hi there, 

I meant to cancel my subscription before the renewal date (9 Jan) but didn't manage to. I am not sure if you are able to see from your records, but I have not used any of Canva's features since December 2020 and definitely not since the subscription automatically renewed itself a few days ago.

I would appreciate your kind understanding in cancelling the subscription and providing a refund.  If a full refund is not possible, a pro-rated one would be acceptable as well. 

Thank you kindly.
