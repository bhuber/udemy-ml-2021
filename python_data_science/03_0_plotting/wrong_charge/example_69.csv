Refund request reason: I cannot remember at any point when I was made aware that I was upgrading to a paid subscription - and notice I have now been charged twice, once in December and now once in January. 

Can you please let me know what I did to begin a paid service? I have no email in my inbox (and I keep most of my emails) that confirms I signed up to a paid service, so at this point cannot see why I have been charged. I have just now cancelled my subscription, but I would like to be refunded my two payments made as well thus far.

If something I did on the site automatically upgraded me to a paid service, I would have at least expected an email confirmation saying so.
