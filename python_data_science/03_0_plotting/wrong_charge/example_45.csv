Refund request reason: Good evening,

I received an unfamiliar charge from Canva. The reason might have been that I signed up for a trial period, which I later decided to not continue with your services. However, I did not receive any warning email before the trial period ended which resulted in me forgetting cancellation. Although, this account is not even email confirmed. 

Your services are great, but we wish to not continue and would like to get a refund. I immediately cancelled the plan as well.

Would love to hear from you soon! And thank you for your time. 

Kindest regards,

Mô tả sự cố của bạn: Hello,
I'd like to cancel my Canva Pro trial period as I was charged €0.1 for the trial period (via IDEAL as I'm in The Netherlands at the moment) and I have NO access to the Canva Pro account. I also didn't receive any confirmation email for my trial period. I wanted to cancel the trial by myself but somehow I couldn't find it in my account. Can you please help me? Below I attached the invoice for the charge so you can check.
