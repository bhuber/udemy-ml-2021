Describe your issue: Hello,

I signed up for a Yearly Pro account on 1/30 through the iOS App and was charged $119.40 under Invoice # <NUMBER>. However, it’s been in stuck pending status and my account was never upgraded to Pro. So, I went ahead and upgraded again, but this time through your website and not through the iOS App under Invoice #  <NUMBER>. Seems like this worked. Please cancel and refund me for Invoice # <NUMBER>.

Thank you,
<NAME>",0.7698115110397339

Refund request reason: Hi There 
I unfortunately missed the cancellation date on my Canva Pro upgrade due to family health issues.
