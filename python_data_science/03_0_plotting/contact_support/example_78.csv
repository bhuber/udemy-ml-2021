Describe your issue: Hi There, Canva has been great so far... It looks like you guys are really listening to what everyday people need to use in their business ventures.  I do have a bit of a organization issue here.  When you log into your page, you can click your designs and you will see the entire plethora of everything you've ever created.  I know there are folders in which you can move your files too, but the issue is that it is difficult to tell apart which files have been assigned to a folder and which have not.  In other words when you log into your page after assigning folder locations, it doesnt physically move the file to a new destination and so if you have a bunch of files mixed up and are trying to sort them it can be confusing to see which ones you have moved/saved to a folder and which ones you have not.   I like cleanliness.. what can I say?  all my desk top folders are easy on the eyes and easy to mitigate visual clutter.  Can you help or implement a way to do this?",0.5832263827323914

Describe your issue: Are you guys SERIOUS??? Hello? Can anyone tell me what the difference between Cloud and Folder storage with Canva Pro. I see that folder storage is unlimited but the cloud is not. What is the difference? I've had a ticket for assistance open and unanswered for 3 months now. It's just a question about how your folder system retains files. I understand COVID and the holidays have made things, difficult, but to get no response from your entire team (except to ask if I still need help) is INSANE. YES, I still need help. No one has bothered to answer my question! 

Can ANYONE answer this simple question??? What is going on over there?",0.3325956463813782
