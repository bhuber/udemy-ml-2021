Describe your issue:  Hello, I wanted to complain about about a problem I had in November that was never resolved by your customer service. I was first originally in touch with someone named <NAME> with the invoice number (<NUMBER>) and under the request # (<NUMBER>). I recieved an unfamiliar charge on my debit card on 11/11/2020. I double checked with my local bank and they informed me that it was a Canva charge. I got no email or invoice from Canva notifying me that my payment has been renewed. I would like to request a refund please. Thank you.",0.40366846323013306

Refund request reason: Forgive us for multiple requests and without the ability to speak to a person...we are trying to figure this out to the best of our ability.  Our acct <EMAIL> should simply have an email change to <EMAIL>  Auto renewal typically occurs in August at 119.40, which we agree with.  However, when a former employee updated the email, a new bill was issued on Sept 4th at a prorate of 109.70.  We are requesting the 109.70 be refunded, as we already pd for the upcoming year at 119.74.  We just don't want to lose any of our projects in this correction.  Nor do we want to cancel our subscription.  Thank you.  Bobbi Jo Bland, interim Children's Ministry Director",0.3423190712928772

Describe your issue: This is a new request for assistance. I received this email response, ""Hi, this support request has been closed on our side because we've either resolved the issue, or because we didn't hear from you in a while.""  Problematic because I never received any previous correspondence from Canva Support so, perhaps, unfortunately for me, these emails went to spam. So, we try again: I need a refund for an account I was never able to access. The invoice also seems to be missing but my corporate credit card was charged. I cannot officially request via the form here without that invoice but I can't actually get one from Canva .... Gonna need some help here. Thank you.",0.2535955309867859
