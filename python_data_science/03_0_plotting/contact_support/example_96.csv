Descreva o problema: 1 week ago I received a Canva credit card charge for a purchase I didn't make. Since then, I try to contact you to solve my problem but without success. I demand the reversal of the amount, I can prove that I did not make any type of subscription. If this is not resolved soon, I will file a lawsuit.

Descreva o problema: good afternoon, I already sent an email a few days ago and I can't get in touch with you.

I do not have access to the email that serves as access to my account, as it has been disabled.

I want to update my account to Canva Pro, but I need it to be for the current email because I don't want to lose all the designs I already have in the current account.

could you please check this out?

my name is Carol Crisóstomo, my phone contact is +<NUMBER>and the best email for contact is <EMAIL>

thank you and I await your return.

Thanks.",0.4233328104019165
