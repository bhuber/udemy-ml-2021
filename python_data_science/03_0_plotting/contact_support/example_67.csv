we just want to thank you for your amazing design tool!

It’s so easy and beautiful!

And we are proud of the first result, it took us just a few hours… : )

Describe your issue: Hello this is my second time contacting customer service because your representative <NAME> has become unresponsive. I did every “fix” on my end that they suggested and nothing resolved the issue. Now I would like some actual assistance with your software error. When I make a video that is laid out vertically (from the top of my phone to the bottom of my phone) it looks great and is able to play in the app. However when I download the video it become a horizontal video (from the left side to the right side of my phone). The art is still vertical so it only a square of it shows up in the middle and it has two blank or white rectangles on either side. I use Canva for my business and this issue is delaying the launch of our companies website. As I mentioned I have already uninstalled/ reinstalled, tried it on a desktop site etc. Please advise",0.7245315909385681

Describe your issue: Hello

I'd realy welcome your help... I realy think Canva's great and it's just so sad there isn't a helpline that can help directly as I have asked this one before.

Presenter View... I have followed every instruction, but I do not get the small wind open, which your instructions say I should slide to one side. 

This is urgent! I have tried and tried to get presenter view. I have just had to do a three day masterclass, wiht slides full of WORDS in them as I need them to prompt me what to say (as no presenter view). I also can't see the next slide coming up!

Please can someone help. 

To get around this, I downloaded it into Powerpoint and went LIVE. Huge mistake as the formatting was all over... this doesn't work. I have had to re record this presentation.

PLEASE - If someone can help on this... I know the system can do it but I really need to see how.

Thanks",0.3540385663509369
