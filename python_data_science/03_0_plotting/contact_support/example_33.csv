Describe your issue: Hello,

I hope this finds you well. I wrote last week regarding a recurring charge of $12.95 for the months Nov, Dec & Jan. I do not have a subscription for an upgraded account. Please respond and refund my account for $38.85. It is quite frustrating to have to send a second message after receiving no response to the first. And to find that you have no customer service phone number, at least to my knowledge. I use a paid subscription for an organization I work with and have found Canva to be a great asset. It is disappointing to experience this side of such a great company. Please respond ASAP.

Best, 
Bonnie Hunter

Describe your issue: I have an open issue that I was speaking with a representative about.  I have not had a response since Dec 27.  The issue I am experiencing is below:

We received several charges of $12.95 on our credit card for our Team Account (Canva* <NUMBER>). I have tried accessing it in the billing area but the invoice isn't showing up.  

I was told in my previous issue conversation that the transaction details are under an email account that we no longer have access to because the individual no longer works with our company.  I would like additional information regarding the charge, to move any future charges to a new email, and potentially remove that user from our account.
