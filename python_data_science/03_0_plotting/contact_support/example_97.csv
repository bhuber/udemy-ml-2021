Describe your issue: God damn you jerks. For 10 days I have sent maybe 10 emails and no one cares. Some useless guy named <NAME> played with me saying lies and now he has gone. Disappeared.

Jerks, let me tell you again. 10 days ago I bought 2 canva 3 months pro subscription from stacksocail and both of the codes did not work. Your crap system said ""EXPIRED"" to those newly bought codes.

And you crap help guy <NAME> played with me saying those codes are okay and have no issue although I have sent him screenshots. Now he got lost and not replying my emails. Shame on him and you.

So stacksocial guy finally tried to get one working code from you crap people but still I need another one since I bought 2.

Is there someone who really care about people's disappointments and frustrations there? Is there someone who really wants to solve the problem of a very sad client there?

10 days guys. 10 days. Maybe 12 I stopped counting. Shame on you.",0.41782650351524353
