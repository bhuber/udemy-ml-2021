You wrongly deducted 107 euros from my wife and we have only been trying to get this back since September 2019. Shame!! See appendix below. Whenever we ask your attention for this, the standard answer comes: “We have closed this file because we have closed it or because we will not hear from you anymore” but in English. Nonsense, we have been working on this for a long time, but nothing succeeds and the request for telephone contact is ignored. Fine everyone. The above amount for a pro subscription, we NEVER had that. We NEVER had an invoice for this amount. This money MUST be refunded but you are making us quite desperate with your policy.

Describe your issue: Dear Canva Admin,

My name is agent Cali JordanGotay representing the CDC. We had used canva on a trial basis and cancelled the subscription o. 11/17/2021. 

However it appears that we have been billed every month up until 1/221/2021 starting on 11/23/2021. As is appears, this is an unauthorized purchase as we cancelled the subscription on 1/17/2020 to  test out the software.

I would like this urgent situation dealt immediately with diligence and compassion. As you can see. I have never used this service. I was directed to scout out the tech for board meeting purposes.

I am sure that I may end up selecting a yearly package based on my needs of employment. I can be reached at <NUMBER>. Hopefully this can be rectified as I may gain clearance to purchase yearly directly through my employer.

I was waiting for an answer because of this in the middle of creation, but there was no reply at all. How long should I wait? 4 hours without an answer. I think it's okay to have an interim report, such as that it will take this much to answer.

Describe your issue: Hi! I've been subscribing to Canva for about 6 months now, and I really love it. But it's literally IMPOSSIBLE to search for elements, it's sooo disorganized, and if I want to find icons in the same family I can literally just forget it. With competitors coming in the market left and right, I would love to see you guys improve the UX of the search function... I feel like I'm constantly searching until I forget what I was ever searching for.

Thanks for listenting.
