Thank you for your response. Are you available for a call to review teams and groups and how they affect an account/payment? I have read the articles and am still confused about how to ask my questions and a phone call would be easiest.

Hello – After speaking with our company’s bank and trying a few different methods (editing billing address, trying to process charge under the admin/team member’s name who is the cardholder, etc), we are still unable to process the charge to upgrade to Canva Pro. I would like to speak to someone from Canva on the phone about this. Can you provide me with a contact number?

I have a paid subscription that does not work, I am unable to use any of the pro features - even though I clearly paid for them. 

My next step is to report Canva to Apple - I have paid for a service I do not receive and after 3 previous customer service requests (listed above) there is still no answer... this is unacceptable. 

i have a;ready sent screencaptures of my invoice, proof of purchase and the error messages in Canva.

Hello <NAME>,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for using Canva print!

I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve encountered some issues on your print order. Let’s get this sorted out right away!

Correct me if I’m wrong, the reprint order came with the same issues of the original order (color inconsistencies and trimming/alignment issues)? And these errors occurred on the same pages which you sent to us on your emails before?

Looking forward to hear from you soon regarding this matter. Thanks!

Cheers,
Lia
