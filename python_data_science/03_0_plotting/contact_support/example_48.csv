Describe your issue: Hi!
I tried to contact you earlier via your web page but didn't receive any answer back. I change my Canva app (on Android) to the new version and it was promised that I can change it back when ever. However I have not been able to change it back at all. 

I use Canva for organisational work and with the new version of the app it's impossible. Version 2.0 is slow, not at all intuitive and very difficult to use via phone. I usually use the paid version but this new version is definitely not worth it. Please provide information to how to change back the previous version of the Canva app.

Sincerely
<NAME> Selin (os <NAME>)",0.38299423456192017
