Describe your issue: My students are using canva and we are having issues with Google sign in if the iPad has already had a Canva account created with another user.  When students click on ""logout"", then click on sign up, they enter their email addresses, and before they can enter their passwords, they are sent directly to the account of another user of Canva.  It is impossible for them to set up an account.  Please assist. I have videoed the issue if you want to see what happens.
