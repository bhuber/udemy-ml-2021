Describe your issue: Pause Canva Pro Account.

Hi there, I'm an opera singer and run a company that provides musicians for live events and concerts and we've taken a real battering (like so many) during the pandemic. 

I love Canva and look forward to a time when I can return to monthly Pro payments, but for the next 5 months, this just isn't viable for us.

I read that we can apply to 'Pause' our Pro Subscription. Please can you do this for me? - Email associated is <EMAIL>

Many thanks,
<NAME>",0.4243062436580658

I would like to pause our membership as of today. The virus has done significant damage to our company, but the fundamentals are strong and we will undoubtedly survive this. That said, we would like to save as much as money as possible till the job market returns. If you could please pause our membership as of today we would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks, Christian",0.24852026998996735
