Baring in mind, I have not only generated bug reports but also come to the concluding fact as to why the problems originated in the first place. 

Therefore, I find, this service to you, a value added engagement of which a customer should not be expected to do so. Therefore, the value you have now received in correlation with developing and maintaining these problems, have now been narrowed down to the individual component.

rTYRVm7jbWvOdsqQ,"Hi There,

Our customer Service team took a call from a Canva customer about the quality of business cards that they received.

Our return address was on the shipping label and that is how the customer came to contact us.

PAESAJBqVTs

PAER 3Vz5YM

 

Apparently the customer was pretty upset, and the sterling customer service rep that handled the call could only pull the concern: “I can’t even read it”.  He was also demanding a refund.

We have re-printed the file from machine’s RIP to attempt to re-produce what the quality issue may have been. 

I don’t see any obvious quality issues that may have been present (even though this order was produced yesterday and not in the exact same environment we ran this sample).

I believe the customer may be referring to the legibility of the “Limited” in script over the logo – which be attributed to a design flaw if the client believes it to be illegible.

The attached photos are from what was ran today, although not UV coated yet.

Perhaps the Canva customer support team can contact the customer and ascertain the exact issue, and if there is quality concerns over and above what we think it may be, get photos so we can investigate further.

Describe your issue: After emailing customer support on numerous occasions with zero reply and providing three separate forms of evidence to prove that payment has been made I am absolutely fuming with the complete lack of customer service I have received and it is simply not good enough. I run a catering business that relies on using canva to create menus weekly so paying for canvas pro in November and  not being able to use the premium service has significantly effected my ability to promote my business. I’ve sent you photos of my receipt from apple showing when I made the payment and my email address linked to the account you claim has no premium service, a photo of the money being taken out of my account as well as a photo showing my subscription to canva on my iPhone that runs out in November 2021 that I am STILL unable to use. What makes it worse is that you don’t even reply to my correspondence. What is going on? If this has been lost please do provide me with an email address that I can happily send the evidence to for your correspondence. The only option I have left is to report your company for taking my money, ignoring my emails and not giving me the service which I have pearly paid for. PLEASE can you sort this out?

I am furious at your lack of service and cryptic help centre.

I have written numerous messages to your help centre with not ONE response. 
Playing the Covid card and 'more than usual story' is simply not good enough! People like me are feeding you money on a monthly basis and you have an obligation to help your clients. I am sure your staff are at home and more than capable of answering your clients questions no differently to normal! If it were a design job, you'd have been sacked months ago!!

I have asked for basic help and not even got a simple auto-response! WTF is going on?? This is totally unethical and simply fair, nor worth the money!!. Seams that you have got too big for your boots and cant service your own market!!??

Now, WHEN can I expect someone to come back to me???? This billing period or in a few months time when I've paid you a further £20/£30??

Lastly, some UX would show you a heap of issues with your site that desperately need attention;
- This box I am writing in for starters cannot be expanded - do you not cherish feedback or constructive criticism, or is that to timely for you? This box service 3 words messages - ridiculous! 
- Where are people to find how many Gb they used in your uploaded area? There is nowhere that tells you how much you have uploaded or require to delete. Files should have size attached to them so you can also see their size.
- Why when deleting do you have to tap delete 3x and can only do one at a time! This takes ages to delete a handful of old images. Can you not select more than one?? Basic stuff...

Lastly, WHY aren't my designs uploading any imagery to my stories?? I have tried everything and cannot get my images to stay in the stories for Insta when I create them. Therefore Canva is not working as advertised... I have emailed you three times about this and I am sure you will have some easy fix.

Describe your issue: To whom it may concern,

I am furious at your lack of service and cryptic help centre.

I have written numerous messages to your help centre with not ONE response. 
Playing the Covid card and 'more than usual story' is simply not good enough! People like me are feeding you money on a monthly basis and you have an obligation to help your clients. I am sure your staff are at home and more than capable of answering your clients questions no differently to normal! If it were a design job, you'd have been sacked months ago!!

I have asked for basic help and not even got a simple auto-response! WTF is going on?? This is totally unethical and simply fair, nor worth the money!!. Seams that you have got too big for your boots and cant service your own market!!??

Now, WHEN can I expect someone to come back to me???? This billing period or in a few months time when I've paid you a further £20/£30??

Lastly, some UX would show you a heap of issues with your site that desperately need attention;
- This box I am writing in for starters cannot be expanded - do you not cherish feedback or constructive criticism, or is that to timely for you? This box service 3 words messages - ridiculous! 
- Where are people to find how many Gb they used in your uploaded area? There is nowhere that tells you how much you have uploaded or require to delete. Files should have size attached to them so you can also see their size.
- Why when deleting do you have to tap delete 3x and can only do one at a time! This takes ages to delete a handful of old images. Can you not select more than one?? Basic stuff...

Lastly, WHY aren't my designs uploading any imagery to my stories?? I have tried everything and cannot get my images to stay in the stories for Insta when I create them. Therefore Canva is not working as advertised... I have emailed you three times about this and I am sure you will have some easy fix.

Can someone come back to me A S A P!
I have a business to run and deadlines to meet.
Thanks,
