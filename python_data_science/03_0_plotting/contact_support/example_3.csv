Describe your issue: Ok first of all, this is my second time having a problem with canva and it would be much easier if you had a customer service line because sitting and waiting for an email back is extremely nerve wracking when I have multiple deadlines. 
My problem right now is that I paid for canva pro with this account, same email, same password, but it says I don't have canva pro, and all my designs are gone. When I made this account, I signed up through Apple ID, so I tried logging in through my phone but it's the same there too. I didn't make a second account and the last time I made a payment was December 28, 2020 and the email was sent to the same email that is attached to this account. Please help me get my designs back.",0.9432457685470581

I have spent a substantial amount of time searching for a telephone number in which to speak directly to Customer Service. I placed a ‘ticket’ in November of 2020 stating I didn’t have access to my Canva account which I had paid a year subscription in August 2020 for. I am sending a second email from my new work address in hopes that I can get some assistance with this issue. I looked for the original email that I sent and unfortunately I have deleted it. So, once again, here is the detailed information that you ask for. I ask that either someone call me on my mobile, as seen in my signature or give me clear direction. I never received a response after submitting my detailed info.

 

I would like to use this subscription since it is costly for my new job and personal use. If I cannot, I would like an reimbursement and even though this has been an arduous process, I would sign-up for your services with a new account.

 

Possible email addresses my account could be under:

* <EMAIL>

* <EMAIL>

* <EMAIL>

 

Last document made:

* I believe one of the last documents I made was a Fall Needs List for the ACS Hope Lodge (it was fall themed background)

Thank you for taking my call. This still isn’t resolved. Like I mentioned on the phone the old manager is causing our company lots of problems at the moment and his cell number is tied to the account so every time we try to log in it sends him a text with a code and he won’t of course send us the codes so we are unable to use the product with my login <EMAIL> The number needs to be changed to <NUMBER>.

Hi,

Our greatest apologies! My mom and I were looking through our info and there was a miscommunication between us on who was replying to this. So sorry for the delay! Here is the info below. Please let us know what else we can provide to fix this!

To find the account, please provide the following information:

1. Details of the last Invoice received:
Canva invoice number/ invoice number from bank statement: CANVA* <NUMBER>+ CANVA*<NUMBER>

Amount: $12.95 each (2 charges) 

Invoice date: 11/02 (CANVA* <NUMBER>)

2. All of the following:
City from which your Canva account was used last: Los Angeles

Operating System from which your Canva account was used last: MacBook IOS

3. At least two of the following:
Canva account username: <NAME> 
Email address/es you may have used when the account was created: <EMAIL>
Date when the account was created:


Looking at my old canva account from college, I see that somehow that account was billed as well which is the mystery solved to this issue. That account username is also <NAME> but email is <EMAIL> I'm wondering if when we asked to renew the subscription if a customer service agent renewed on this account since my name was the same. I'm not sure how this happened! Would you be able to refund charges on the <EMAIL> As of now we see 2 statements (Nov & Dec) on that account. We are only using the <EMAIL> canva account. 

We look forward to hearing back from you soon. Thank you so much!!

My name is Paula Tuazon and I received by credit card bill today with two unfamiliar Canva charges in my account.  I believe these purchases are not under my accounts. 
Details of the charges are the following:
1. 12/16/<NUMBER>/20/20 CANVA* <NUMBER>HTTPSCANVA.CO US 649.00
 Reference: <NUMBER>
Amount: Php 649.00
2. 01/16/<NUMBER>/17/21 CANVA* <NUMBER>HTTPSCANVA.CO US 649.00
 Reference: <NUMBER>
<NAME>: Php 649.00

Total for the two charges: Php 1,298. 
Please also know that I have three canva accounts under my watch. Email addresses of the canva accounts are the following: 
1. <EMAIL>
2. <EMAIL>
3. <EMAIL>
But I have NO ACTIVE subscriptions/ purchases under these three accounts.  Please see screenshots of my billing subscription details below for your reference. These screenshots were captured today (Jan.19, 2021) and it is stated in my account settings for the three accounts that I have NO ACTIVE subscriptions.
Also, the two charges that I have as mentioned above do not reflect in the “invoices” portion of my three canva accounts.  Screenshots of the invoices portion of my two accounts under paulatuazon.pt @gmail.com and <EMAIL> are attached for your reference. As for my <EMAIL> canva account, my invoices portion appears to be empty because I haven’t purchased anything using this account. 
Hope you can help me about this matter and may I please request for the reversal of these charges. 
Thank you.

Hi there,
I would like to keep this query open as it has not been resolved.
I am the sole account holder so it would not have been a question of me being removed. 
Have attached a series of videos made on canva that I can no longer see. It was an extensive library of designs.
I can see that my Canva account is billed to an additional email address: <EMAIL> - wondered if that was the account used. Tried to forget password, but still have not received a password reset email.
Please advise on what to do next.

Best,

Hi there,

Thanks for getting back to us and apologies for the late reply.

We reviewed the email address <EMAIL> and can confirm that it has an active subscription via Apple.

Additionally, we used the invoice number <NUMBER>and found an account. It is registered with the email address <EMAIL> address. (The email address is masked for security purposes.) Do you recognize this email address? If yes, do you still have access to it?

Looking forward to your next reply.
