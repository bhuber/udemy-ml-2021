Describe your issue: Your ""you are about to leave the Canva website"" warning is needlessly scary to the end user. If I have a newsletter presented as a website with a link and the user clicks, it introduces needless fear that the user is going to a dark site. The link out should be treated like ANY OTHER LINK on the web.. This is a silly precaution, and one that hinders the ability of a user to CONVERT a potential viewer to a new web page...

Describe your issue: Hi!

As of today, when clicking on a clickable object on one of my Canva infographics, the user gets the ""You are about to leave Canva"" warning. This is extremely disruptive, as my students need to an extra click to access the linked document (such as a pdf). This is a new situation (there was no warning in 2020).

How can I remove this warning and give my users a direct access to the linked file when they click on a clickable item?

For instance:
