Describe your issue: When I came to present my presentation, the presenter view (i.e. my notes) also showed to the audience on Teams. I had to do my presentation without notes. How can I stop this happening in the future?
Also, when I record presentations, where do they save to? I can't seem to find the recording apart from on the link.
