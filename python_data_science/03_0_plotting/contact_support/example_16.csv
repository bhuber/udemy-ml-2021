Describe your issue: Hello
Canva has been crashing for me and for my body the last couple of days. We operate from 2 different phones and an iPad and the app has been glitching for almost anything we try to do on the posts we’re creating. Not sure if it’s a website problem or what the steps are to troubleshoot. 
Hope you’re having a blessed day,

Describe your issue: Dear sir/madame,

I've been using Canva Android app for a while for my small business and have seen the developments over time.
Sadly your recent update has been a bit.. off. My overview of my designs has been some content; some designs look completely blank while others have missing pictures. The app is also extremely laggy and slows down my phone (while the previous version was pretty do-able).

I would like to recommend maybe a lighter version of the app or give people the option to downgrade it, or make specific versions available on your site (as I can see on the Google Play Appstore reviews that people have been complaining about the lag of newer versions as well).

If possible I can send you a screenshot of the design overview.

Thank you in advance for the assistance and hope to hear from you soon.

With kind regards,

Mrs. <NAME>.",0.2523740828037262
