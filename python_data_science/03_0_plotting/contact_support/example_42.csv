Hi <NAME>,

Thank you so much for registering for our Canva for Nonprofits program. Unfortunately the documentation you provided was rejected due to any of the following reasons: 

- Document does not match our Eligibility Guidelines - if you're unsure of what documentation we accept, you can refer to this link: <URL> 
- Organization name in your document does not match the organization name in your application - please include proof in case of name change 
- Incomplete documents for group exemptions - e.g. for United States, application must include both the 501c(3) determination letter from IRS and a letter from the parent organization stating that your organization is included in the group exemption 

Feel free to re-submit your application once you have the correct documentation, here's the link again: <URL> 

If you are not able to provide the documentation required for a nonprofit account, don't worry! You can continue to use <URL> free, just like millions of other people around the globe.

Cheers,
The Canva Team
