However, the one that does NOT align here, aligns when you download it, and the one that DOES look aligned here, does NOT line up when you download it.  I was sent a few options to try to fix it, none of which worked, and then the case was closed.  I'm very unhappy right now, and expect more support.

Describe your issue: I'm using Google Chrome, and for some reason, only when I'm on Canva do I have this issue: I'm typing out text on a template, and it ALWAYS uppercases my ""i"" when it's at the start of a word, even though the word is not at the beginning of the sentence. On other websites, when I type an ""i"", it'll upcase it if it ends up being the word ""I"", but not otherwise. 

This behavior is extremely irritating and has already caused for me to have to take down social media posts designed on Canva because I later on realized that there was a word that randomly started with an upper case ""I"" in the middle of a sentence.
