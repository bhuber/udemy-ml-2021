I wrote in requiring help with a payment issue and I received a reply that did not at all help me resolve my issue. The person who replied wrote ""I am just an email away"" and yet when I try to reply I get an error message saying my reply cannot go through.

I signed up for canva pro. As I was going through this process I thought I would be prompted to choose a method of payment before my card on file was automatically charged. This was not the case. I planned to pay for the subscription using a business credit card. I would like someone to contact me to have this sorted out.

I would like a refund on the card that was charged and I would like to submit a new credit card to pay for the canva pro subscription.

Describe your issue: Hello. I need to speak to a supervisor. I have had a pro account for a long time. My card needed to be updated by a certain date to maintain my pro price of $9.95/month. I updated the card in time but was not granted the price match. I now am charged $14.99/month. I was told, via email, it was a time zone matter. I do not see where a certain time zone was mentioned in the terms.  Here is the actual response: “Hi <NAME>,

Thanks for confirming ownership of this email account.

We reviewed your account under <EMAIL> and confirmed that the initial attempt to renew your paid subscription on December 13, 2020 has failed. There is a maximum of four (4) attempts to charge your card within 16 days from the original bill date. This gives you time to update your credit card information or to settle any issues causing the payment to fail.

We can confirm that your card has already been updated as of December 29, 2020. However, our billing system follows the GMT timezone. This explains why it may appear that you were charged earlier than the time you updated your card.

Since none of the payment attempts succeeded, your subscription was automatically downgraded by our system. There will be no further attempts to charge your card for your plan's renewal.

The original subscription you had was an offer we had way back January 2020 and its not being offered anymore or its already a grandfathered one. This promo is not available anymore in our system and the reason why we cannot resubscribe you to that same offer anymore. Note that each offer pricing we have will continuously apply to user's account if availed unless the user cancel it or was cancelled automatically by the system due to failed payment.

Our current offer is the Pay for 1, Get 4 free Canva Pro promo that will allow you to add up to four (4) members in your Canva Pro team for the price of just one (1) member: $12.95 USD monthly or $119.40 USD annually. You can avail of this offer by subscribing to Canva Pro from November 2, 2020 to January 31, 2021.

I would like a phone call or email with a supervisor please.  I have asked for said contact via that email conversation with no response. 
Thank you so much!
