Describe your issue: Dear Support,

I have used Canva and it served me very well for my studies and for doing professional documents.  I have now finished my Masters and would like to stop the subscription.  I wanted to ask, once I stop the subscription, will I lose access to the documents I created?  Or will I just be unable to create new ones?

Best Regards
Adrian",0.22332721948623657
