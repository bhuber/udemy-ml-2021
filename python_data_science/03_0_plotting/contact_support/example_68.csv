Describe your issue: Really starting to get frustrated as this is my 3rd time sending this message and no one seems to be getting back to me. If I create a website template on canva and click to launch the website, does this launch a full functioning website that supports payments? I really hope someone will get back to me on this as I am considering paying for canva pro but if there is a lack of customer service I am not willing to spend my money",0.5375717878341675

Describe your issue: Hello, I created a Canva website. When someone clicks on any of the links on my website it gives them a message letting them know that they are about to leave Canva and visit an external website. Is there a way to turn off this notification to people that are viewing my page, so that it looks more professional? I'm afraid I'm going to have to recreate my website in Squarespace.

Describe your issue: I am new and looking around.
I notice you have a website option, but there is zero information about what is included, so I am trying to find out before proceeding.
for example, how do you compare to <NAME>?
do you host the website too? how much per month, or year, do you charge?
do you have apps, such as chat, payment facilities, etc, that can be included, the same as in a <NAME> setup?
Can you point me to full information about your website building area please. A little confused if i should build a website with you or with <NAME>. Just no information on your site about your website building facilities.
Thanks for your help.",0.20596033334732056
