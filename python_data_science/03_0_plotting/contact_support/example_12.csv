I'm still waiting for someone to contact me about my account please.
I fully understand that we can just ended the Christmas season and some of you may not be in your actual working office, but please understand my frustration that I've gone nearly a week without access to my pre-designed folders, therefore i am behind with my work and replying to customers. And what hurts the most is that this happens the day after your payment goes through! Very upsetting.

I look forward to your speedy reply.
