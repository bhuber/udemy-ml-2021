Describe your issue: Hi there! First I need to say that this is the 3rd time I'm contacting you in the last month, as no one got back to me. Could someone please reply to this message? 
The reason I've been contacting you is because I've been paying $38.85 for me and other 2 people on my team, but I've seen you have an offer for 5 people for £10.99. How can I get this offer with my existing account, please?  I have more people to add and it's really unfair that I loyal customer has to pay a LOT more than someone who just signed up. Thanks so much for your help!",0.8542903065681458

Describe your issue: I have had major issues this month. I am unable to move graphics and text, changing the size, even writing.

I've had issues before, but this is dreadful.

I pay for Canva Pro (Which im happy to do as I run a business), but I am not prepared to pay when the thing doesn't work. But the thing I dislike most is that when I'm paying for your service, there is no clear customer service line and email address anywhere. I'm simply not prepared to pay for something with this poor regard for paying customers.

I am hoping a manager will contact me as soon as possible, but I am not prepared to pay further until issues are fixed, and I am given proper customer service access for the future.

There are other similar services.

Please confirm that this month will be free in the email.

My email address is <EMAIL>",0.6684011816978455
