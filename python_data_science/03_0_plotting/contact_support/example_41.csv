Describe your issue: I need to speak with someone over the phone.   Your printing feature will not allow more than 1,000 copies.  I need 3,000.  Your support said to copy design and print again.  This seems silly to have to pay for shipping more than once.  Well now the second order is very different in cost than the first order.

Describe your issue: Hi. I don't have a problem but I'd like to talk with someone on the phone about a print order before I place it. Here's the job I'd like to print (<URL>

Specifically, I'd like to talk about your recommendations of matte, gloss, uncoated since it has so much color. Also, do these come already folded? And do we have an option of Z-fold vs. folding in on itself to create a self-mailer as I've designed? My number is <NUMBER>. Thanks!

Describe your issue: I asked for your help 3 DAYS AGO!! I am a paying customer and you have not answered and don't even provide a phone number or chat option... unbelievable!!
I expect a satisfactory answer today or I am requesting a full refund of the payment made to you for a service/product that I have not received and not being able to contact with someone from that company to voice my issue an ask for the help that I am entitled to.
My iusse:
I created a logo and sent it to print but the quality of the printing is terribly poor, lines and images are blurry and the colors are totally different from the ones chosen for the design. I am not able to use the cards paid for and every other printing services that I have tried uploading the design to see a proof comes back with the same issues. Please provide exact information on how to get my design printed appropriately since the purpose of paying for the premium package was to be able to create a printable design that is not only pretty on the screen but usable for what it is intended.
