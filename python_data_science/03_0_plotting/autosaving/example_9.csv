Describe your issue: Hi there,

I've been having issues with my image saving - they come up with a black gradient border on the left and right side that is not there in any images saved - the quality of the images are high so I'm not sure why it keeps saving with these black borders.  

I'm not sure how to add the saved image within this chat though - i've screenshotted the before image though.
