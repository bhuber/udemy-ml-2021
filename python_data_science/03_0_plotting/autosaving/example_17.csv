Describe your issue: Basically, the website works for me only half the time. I log in and the home page works fine, but when I go to create any design the page loads a couple of the blue page elements but then stops (I.E. the page's background colors but no text or anything) the page stops loading like its completed its process but there not much on the page. 
I use a PC
Does the same on Chrome and Edge

It should be noted that this is one of the only sites that Ive visited that halts my access in with Cloud fare and requires me to fill out a CAPSHA nearly every time. It gets old. But that's neither here nor there.

I did FINALLY get a 503 error code after refreshing the page several times.",0.14234772324562073
