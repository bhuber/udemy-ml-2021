The images I take on the website or app are misaligned in the app when I download. It wasn't like that, it was after the penultimate update. I already deleted it, installed it again, more than once and the error persists. It is already updated and nothing has changed in that part. I don't know what to do, I love your app very much, but it's difficult to use.",0.17756736278533936

Describe your issue: I love your app but my god there are so many glitches.
There‚Äôs not a single time that I‚Äôve used it over the last 6 months that there hasn‚Äôt been an issue.

Some of the issues are minor and I can work my way around them but many of the issues leave me unable to use the app and extremely irritated! I rely on this app for my business so it is very frustrating when there‚Äôs so many issues with it.

Currently one of my designs glitches when I open it and the screen just flashes and won‚Äôt let me edit it or even go back to the Home Screen so the app is useless at the moment.
Quite often when I save my work when I go to the image in my camera roll it‚Äôs blank and the photo from my design hasn‚Äôt transferred so instead I have to screen shot and the crop it. Another common occurrence that is also very annoying.",0.12216228991746902
