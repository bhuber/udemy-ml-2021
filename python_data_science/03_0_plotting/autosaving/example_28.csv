Describe your issue: Hello, 
I am trying to access a project and every time I open it, I receive a message saying that it didnt' save properly and to reload it. I'm given the option to reload or cancel. Every time I hit reload it gives me the same error message. From what I can tell, it's only happening with the one project (Bloom Emagazine Winter) and not others. 

Many thanks for your help.

Describe your issue: I had my tab open for a few hours and reopened my design that was auto saving perfectly fine before, as I go to continue editing the design, I get an error message saying that there was an error with saving the project.  The pop up gave me two options which was to reload the page or close; I reloaded the page, the same thing occurred.  I then decided to exit and close the page completely and reloaded the design, which had be saved fine, but still was not allowing me to edit and giving the recurring saving error message.  It currently just says 'Saving error' in the top left had corner near the 'View' drop-down option.  Not sure what could be happening..
