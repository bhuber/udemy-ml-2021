Describe your issue: Hello, I've been using Canva for these past 2 years, and I found some ""bug"" when I use Canva in MacOS. When I use element such as ""frame"" or ""grid"" with picture in it, the picture is always out of the box (not in the real size), it's bother me because I need to export it first to see the actual size, to see the actual design I already did. 

And there's is a ""bug"" too when I use a text box. So many times, I design for an article in Canva, and when I save it, the text box is not like when I design. 

I think that's 2 main problems that bother me so much when I use Canva in my <NAME>. I really hope that Canva team can fix it. Thank you for your amazing services! I love Canva so much!",0.32195067405700684
