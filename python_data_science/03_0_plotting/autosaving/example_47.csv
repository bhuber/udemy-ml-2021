Describe your issue: When I created my logo and then saved it, the entire page was saved as my logo. Now I cannot fit my logo to many places. If I copy my logo, then paste it onto a Word Doc, I can't fit two on one page because the entire page has been identified as the logo. This effects resizing, which then keeps me from being able to  place the logo in  different locations on a document. Sending a screenshot would not make any sense because it would just look like a logo on each page. I'm just newly mucking away through your software and am not tech savvy. I cannot figure out to fix this problem. Could you please assist?  Thank you, Sue Rouillard",0.7575446963310242
