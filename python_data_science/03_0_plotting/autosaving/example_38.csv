Describe your issue: I create an initial design. I go to Save and Move to Folder assuming that design will then be saved to that folder. 

I then modify that same base template with a new background and text layout, download the image and in Canva do a manual File/Save and then move to Folder, again assuming that version of the design will also be saved to that folder. 
But none of the versions except the very last version is in the folder when I log back in to make modifications to one of the versions. 
What am I not doing correctly to have Every version I press Save on and move to the same folder appear ready for future editing?

miqt3q,"What kind of problem ?: Saving Describe the problem: Hello dear support team, I have been using Canvas for the first time this month and have great difficulties saving, which unfortunately are not answered in your FAQ. It seems to me that there is more of a technical error. When I create a design, e.g. a quote in an IG <NAME>, I want to save several variants (not version history) side by side in a folder. The design interface then correctly states that the folder contains 3 files. But when I go to my start page and want to open the corresponding folder there, a maximum of one design is saved in each folder. So far I have stored my designs wildly everywhere, as templates etc., in the hope that some of them will be saved. It seems to me that I can save a maximum of 1 design and 1 template per folder, but not always, and it's a matter of luck whether the design shown is the first or last saved. The best thing for me is to save everything as a template. So either there is some logic behind the saving that I don't get, or something isn't working. I don't have any team members, I work alone. So I don't think it could have anything to do with the releases. I would be very happy to receive an answer soon.",0.4732417166233063
