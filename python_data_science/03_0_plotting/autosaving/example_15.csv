Describe your issue: To whom it may concern,

It seams every time I create something as of late the images decide not to download with the finished design. It’s beyond frustrating and wasting an enormous amount of my time. 

I have a short video of the exact problem but there is no where to add that to this complaint.

I look forward to hearing from you to try and resolve this before I decide to delete my account. 

Thanks,
Cal",0.3083392083644867
