Describe your issue: I had some issues with the previous help report, so forgive me if this is duplicative. I have been getting an error message on Canva for the past month or so and it refuses to save any of my work altogether. The initial message is: ""We've locked the editor because we couldn't save your changes. You can continue editing, but you might lose your work."" 
The next message that appears is ""Your recent changes haven't been saved. You might lose your work."" and the top bar just keeps saying ""Connecting..."" without saving anything. When I try to close out of the project it warns me that all changes will be lost, but even if I try to Keep Changes, it puts me back into the same loop of error messages. 

Is this something you can fix on your? Unfortunately we have a whole team that is awaiting changes from me and I can't do much without the ability to save. Thank you!
