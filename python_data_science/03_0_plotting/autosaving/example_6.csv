After completing a design with 7 pages, I tried to save it from the save option whilst still having the design open. It saved all of the pages but the background image for some of them was missing. I attempted this multiple times and experienced the same issue. I then tried to save the design from the screen which shows all of my designs by clicking on the top left of the design and clicking save. Whilst most of the images saved correctly, two of them did not. I need to complete this design for a work project. Please can you assist further? Thank you.
