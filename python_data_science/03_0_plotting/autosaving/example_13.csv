Beskriv ditt problem: Today, me and a friend tried Canva, with very mixed results. Since I have tried it earlier I did a few designs. And my friend then did some changes. (Me on Win 10/Edge, He on MacOS/Safari). After a few changes the whole design was corrupted with text changed/moved, pictures or videos from other designs all of a sudden visible, etc. And since the auto save is set on a very long time there was no going back to the original... This happened three times in a row. And of course, this was very awkward, as I wanted to show Canva off as a great platform for multiple uses. 
If these types of errors occur often, I can't really see the benefit. The time to start all over again and again would just not be worth it.

Describe your issue: Reporting an issue with downloading a completed video.

My wife attempted to download a finished video through Chrome on her MacBook Air Chrome. When the progress bar was 3/4 done, the fan kicked on and the computer was working hard. The progress bar *almost* completed but seemed to hang, fan going like crazy, yet it never finished. I stopped it after a minute which should have been plenty of time.

I also tried it on my mid-2012 MacBook Pro through the Brave Browser. I experienced the same issue.

My system specs:
mid-2012 MacBook Pro (13-inch)
macOS Catalina v.10.15.7
16GB RAM
1TB SSD Drive
Brave Browser (Version 1.19.86 Chromium: 88.0.4324.96 (Official Build) (x86 64)

Oddly enough, downloading through our mobile devices was a breeze. Her's is an iPad Air2 and I used my iPhone 7Plus using the Canva app. The finished file size was only 15MB.

UPDATE: I just tried using <NAME> on <NAME>. Same as before but this time the fan didn't come on. Here's a screen shot of the progress bar
