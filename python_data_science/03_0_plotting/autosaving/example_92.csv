Describe your issue: I left my laptop to do something and the Canva tab was open. When I came back, my laptop was locked so I opened it; my Canva project said that the changes weren't saved. There was a reload page option so I pressed it but the same notice appeared, it repeatedly appeared when I reload it. Also, when I leave the project and return it, the same notice still appeared. I hope this problem is resolved because this is due on January 19.
