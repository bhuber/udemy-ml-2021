Describe your issue: I had trouble with a design reverting back to the original template. I emailed around the 6th of January and was by the 22nd of January given links to my supposed designs. Trusted that they were correct and that was that. Here I am, a few weeks later trying to access those design links from the email, which are my resume, kinda important, and find out that they link to some random generic orange design that I have never used in my life. So could someone please please please help me resurrect my resume and why is it that my cover letter design has saved perfectly well but the resume is what is missing. Links below to explain... Link to my design (resume) which is actually just a link to the original template with no editing: <URL>

The two links I was given that were apparently from the version history of the above link I'd given...
