Opišite svoj problem: Hello!
I have a problem downloading images on the WEB APPLICATION. I have been your user for a long time and it has never happened to me. I have written to you once and you have not been able to solve anything, and this has been going on for days. So the problem is this:

After I make a normal design, with ok line spacing, and then the same design download, the line spacing is AUTOMATIC CHANGE. I try to change, visibly change, save the changed design and save it again with the changed spacing. I also have video proof.

I believe in you and I believe it’s just an ordinary bug, but please, it takes too long. Please resolve.

Your faithful user, <NAME>.",0.31697720289230347
