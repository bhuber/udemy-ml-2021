Describe your issue: None of my graphics are downloading into pptx or google slides. I had not had a problem with this in the past, and I am aware that some formatting might be lost, but literally every graphic is saying ""could not load"" which has made it really difficult to use canva at my workplace. I have tried manually saving, using a different browser, deleting browser history, and have made sure my internet connection is stable. I have been using workarounds, but being able to just download my designs would make my life so much easier!",0.26862677931785583

Describe your issue: I had youtube connected to my account so that I could put videos in my presentation. Today it is saying ""we were unablle to carry out the search request at this time. Please check your connection and try again later.""

I am connected to the internet. Canva saves changes with no issues. I have logged out and logged back in. Disconnected youtube and reconnected it. Waiting a few hours and tried again and it is doing the same thing.
