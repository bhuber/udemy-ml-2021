Describe your issue: Every time I try to open the graphic I am working on (TERF ISLAND), it spools forever and then freezes my entire laptop completely! This has been going on for weeks. For a while, I could get it to open after multiple tries and letting it spool for half an hour, but now it won't open at all. I am beyond frustrated.
