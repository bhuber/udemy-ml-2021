I would like to ask you to add a small, but in my opinion, a useful function. I have all my works, designs are divided into several themes (sizes) and, accordingly, over time, many pictures have accumulated in one theme. Sometimes I need to see them all, and at this moment it will be very convenient if there is a button that will help to go to the first picture or vice versa to the last one. And even when creating a new picture already in the old design, where the photos have accumulated, the new picture is created the second in a row, and I would like them to be in exactly the sequence of their creation, so every time you create it, you have to raise it up. These are my whims)) But it seems to me that with such little things it will become even more convenient to work in this program! Thank you for attention!",0.19837069511413574

Describe your issue: When downloading presentations into PPT, and then attempting to print such with NOTES (that were input in Canva) the notes are cutting off the page. It also places the slides to the right position, instead of centered, like what would happen if the document was directly created in PPT. This is a huge issue because I need to turn this in for an assignment and show the notes, and given it's distortion, I have to completely rebuild it in PPT directly, instead of Canva, which does not give me confidence if switching to paid version. This happens regardless of the browser used and appears to be an issue with Canva's PPT conversion. I can't include a Snapshot because you can only see this issue when downloading the PPT, and then attempting to print the presentation using the NOTES function, which your ""add screenshot"" does not allow for.

Describe your issue: I have contacted Canva multiple times about a bug and not had one response back yet. This relates to designs that I make where the layout of text does not match what I have created (I centre something in the design but when I download it the copy is off centre on the downloaded design) - this is becoming tedious and incredibly  frustrating. 
Can this bug be fixed once and for all please as im wasting time and having to screen grab my designs rather than download them in high resolution  to get the actual design that I created -  Please see attached my design in Canva and my downloaded design - when this is downloaded the copy is no longer  centred - I can upload the downloaded design due to the limitation of this chat functionality .
