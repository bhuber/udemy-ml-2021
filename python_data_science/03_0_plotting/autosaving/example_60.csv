Describe your issue: Possible UI bug. Before I had logged in I saw that the top-toolbar text ""To save your design Sign up or Log in"" looked like it was italicized by the browser. In other words, it wasn't the native Open Sans Italic and looked a little compressed and less perfect than it could. 

See img: <URL>

Or maybe you've chosen to italicize with the browser to reduce loading time, in which case, no bug.
